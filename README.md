## Python and SageMath Implementations for Computations on Partially Ordered Sets ##
This is repo contains several notebook implementations of various algorithms applicable to partially ordered sets. The primary one is Atkinson's algorithm, which is used to compute linear extensions of tree posets in quadratic time. I do not know of any other publicly available implementation.

This repo is also used for my research in partially ordered sets.
